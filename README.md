# Realtime, Web RTC Text and Video Chat

This is a simple web application that allows users to chat with each other in real time.
The application uses Web RTC to establish a peer-to-peer connection between users. Users can send text messages and share their video feed with each other.

# Important

- Please replace the SERVICE_ID and OWNER_ID in the `service.js` file with your own values.
You can get these values by signing up, and creating your own service on [Skapi](https://www.skapi.com).

- Web RTC requires a secure connection (HTTPS) to work. Host `index.html` and `service.js` in a https environment.
